    "Set Comprehensions in Python\n",
    "Set comprehensions are a concise way to create sets in Python using a single line of code. The syntax is similar to dictionary comprehensions and list comprehensions, but the result is a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax\n",
    "The basic syntax of a set comprehension is:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copiar código\n",
    "{expression for item in iterable if condition}\n",
    "expression: The value that will be added to the set.\n",
    "item: The current element of the iterable.\n",
    "iterable: A list, tuple, string, etc.\n",
    "condition: An optional expression that filters the items.\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "Example 1: Creating a Simple Set\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a set that contains the numbers from 0 to 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copiar código\n",
    "numbers = {x for x in range(5)}\n",
    "print(numbers)\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Copiar código\n",
    "{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}\n",
    "Here, each number from 0 to 4 is added to the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2: Using Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "We can include a condition to filter the items. For example, let's create a set with the even numbers from 0 to 9:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copiar código\n",
    "even_numbers = {x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0}\n",
    "print(even_numbers)\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Copiar código\n",
    "{0, 2, 4, 6, 8}\n",
    "In this case, only the even numbers were included in the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3: Creating a Set from a String\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use set comprehensions to extract unique characters from a string:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copiar código\n",
    "phrase = \"hello world\"\n",
    "unique_chars = {char for char in phrase}\n",
    "print(unique_chars)\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "arduino\n",
    "Copiar código\n",
    "{'h', 'e', 'l', 'o', ' ', 'w', 'r', 'd'}\n",
    "Here, all characters from the string were added to the set, but duplicates were automatically eliminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages\n",
    "Conciseness: Set comprehensions allow for compact set creation, saving lines of code.\n",
    "Readability: When used correctly, they make the code more readable and expressive.\n",
    "Elimination of Duplicates: Sets, by definition, do not allow duplicate elements, making this approach useful for ensuring all elements are unique.\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "Set comprehensions are a powerful and efficient tool in Python for creating sets in a clear and concise manner. They are particularly useful when you want to apply transformations or filter elements efficiently. "
