    "# Match Case Statement (switch statements)\n",
    "\n",
    "The match case statement was introduced in Python 3.10 as a form of pattern matching, similar to switch statements in other languages like C or Java. It allows you to compare an expression against multiple patterns and execute the block of code corresponding to the first matching pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`expression`: The expression that will be evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pattern`: The value or structure you are trying to match against the expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "`_`: A wildcard pattern that captures any value that does not match the previous patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "match expression:\n",
    "    case pattern1:\n",
    "        # Code to execute for pattern1\n",
    "    case pattern2:\n",
    "        # Code to execute for pattern2\n",
    "    case _:\n",
    "        # Code to execute if no patterns match\n"

    "### **Advantages of Match Case**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clarity:** The match case can make code more readable and organized compared to multiple if-elif statements, especially when handling several conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complex Patterns:** It allows for matching complex data structures like lists and dictionaries in a more intuitive way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance:** While the performance difference may not be significant in most cases, match can be more efficient than many chained if-elif statements, especially with complex matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Final Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "The match case statement provides a new way to structure control logic in Python, enabling a more declarative and less verbose programming style. It is particularly useful when working with structured data and can make your code cleaner and easier to understand."
