    "\n",
    "### Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **if statement** allows you to execute a block of code conditionally based on whether an expression is true or false. It can be combined with `elif` (else if) and `else` to handle multiple conditions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- The **while loop** is useful for situations where the number of iterations is not known in advance and depends on a condition, allowing for flexible repetition of code.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- The **for loop** is a powerful tool for executing a block of code multiple times for each item in a sequence or range, while the `range()` function provides a flexible way to generate sequences of numbers for iteration.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Nested loops** allow for more complex iterations, which are useful for working with multi-dimensional data structures like lists of lists. However, be cautious, as they can lead to increased time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Control Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`break:`** Exits the loop entirely.\n",
    "- **`continue:`** Skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next.\n",
    "- **`pass:`** Acts as a placeholder without performing any action.\n",
    "\n",
    "These control statements help manage the flow of loops and conditionals in Python effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **`enumerate()` function** is a convenient way to loop over a sequence while retrieving both the index and the value. It enhances code clarity and reduces the need for extra variables to track indices.\n"
