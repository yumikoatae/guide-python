    "What is if __name__ == '__main__'\n",
    "This construct is used to determine whether a module (Python file) is being run as the main program or if it is being imported into another module. When a Python file is executed, the special variable __name__ is set to '__main__'. If the file is imported, __name__ will be set to the name of the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Use It\n",
    "Test Code: It allows you to include code that should only run when the module is executed directly, such as tests or examples of function usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: It helps keep the code organized, allowing parts of it to be reusable without executing unnecessary code when the module is imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copiar c√≥digo\n",
    "def greeting(name):\n",
    "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    print(greeting(\"Maria\"))  # This code will only run if the file is executed directly.\n",
    "Summary\n",
    "Location: You can include this construct in the functions section (as this is generally where functions are defined) or in a section about modules.\n",
    "Functionality: It allows you to conditionally execute code based on how the file is called."
